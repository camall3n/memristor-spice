Memristor SPICE

Circuit simulator forked from Berkeley SPICE 3f5, with modifications to support memristors natively.

- Based off Berkeley SPICE 3f5
- Implements memristors natively as devices with prefix "a".
- Handles hard-switching boundary conditions.
- Has support for parsing input parameters from netlists.
- Supports window function for modeling nonlinear dopant-drift.
- Tested on Mac OS X 10.6.7
